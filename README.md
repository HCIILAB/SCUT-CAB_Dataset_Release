## Description
<!-- The SCUT-CAB Dataset contains 4000  images of Chinese ancient books, including 31,931 layout element annotations, which contains different binding forms, fonts, and preservation conditions. To facilitate multiple tasks of layout analysis, the dataset is divided into two parts: CAB-Physical for physical layout analysis and CAB-Logical for logical layout analysis.  CAB-Physical contains 4 classes including 31,931 layout elements annotations, CAB-Logical contains 27 classes including 31,931 layout elements annotations. The SCUT-CAB dataset also contains the labeling of the reading order. -->
The SCUT-CAB Dataset is established by manually annotating 4000 images of ancient books, including 31,931 layout element annotations, which contains different binding forms, fonts, and preservation conditions. To facilitate the multiple tasks involved in document layout analysis, the dataset is segregated into two subsets: SCUT-CAB-Physical for physical layout analysis and SCUT-CAB-Logical for logical layout analysis. SCUT-CABPhysical contains four categories, whereas SCUT-CAB-Logical contains 27 categories. Furthermore, the SCUT-CAB dataset comprises the labeling of the reading order.

## Examples of SCUT-CAB
<!-- Data source:
  + Buddhist scriptures. The dataset of MTHv2 contains Buddhist scripture datasets of various layouts, which are suitable for layout analysis tasks. Bud-
dhist scriptures are rich in content, including political, ethical, philosophical, literature, art, customs etc.
+ Chinese Remade Rare Book. Rare books are the essence of ancient book culture. Selected and representative precious classics in the history of books
and editions.

+ Reproductions of Chinese Rare Editions Series, which covers the essence of Chinese cultural classics to the greatest extent. It has a high documentary value, academic research value and preservation value. All the books in this series are in the form of photocopying, According to the original book layout, they are photographed, printed, and collected, and they are carefully crafted. 
+ Local chronicles, one of the essential sources for studying Chinese history over the past thousand years. They contain copious materials on local administration, local economies, local cultures, local dialects, local officials, and local dignitaries.
