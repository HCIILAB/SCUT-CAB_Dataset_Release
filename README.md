## Description

The SCUT-CAB Dataset contains 4000  images of Chinese ancient books, including 31,931 layout element
annotations, which contains different binding forms, fonts, and preservation conditions. To facilitate multiple tasks
of layout analysis, the dataset is divided into two parts: CAB-Physical for physical layout analysis and CAB-Logical for logical layout analysis. 
CAB-Physical contains 4 classes including 31,931 layout elements annotations, CAB-Logical contains 27 classes including 31,931 layout
elements annotations. The SCUT-CAB dataset also contains the labeling of the reading order.

## Examples of SCUT-CAB
Data source:
  + Buddhist scriptures. The dataset of MTHv2 contains Buddhist scripture
datasets of various layouts, which are suitable for layout analysis tasks. Bud-
dhist scriptures are rich in content, including political, ethical, philosophical,
